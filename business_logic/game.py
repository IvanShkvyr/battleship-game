Game module.

This module implements the core logic and structure of a Battleship game,
including:

- Board representation and ship placement (both automatic and manual).
- Ship validation rules such as adjacency and straight line placement.
- Game state management using a finite state machine pattern.
- States include: not started, setup ships, playing, and finished.
- Interaction with user input/output is abstracted via GameInputOutput
    interface.

Classes:
- Board: manages the game board, ships, and their positions.
- GameState (abstract): base class for game states.
- NotStartState, SetupShipsState, PlayingState, FinishedState: concrete game
    states.
- Game: main game controller, holds the state machine and boards.
